A scientific computing library written in Ruby
This is going to be the biggest project I've done so far. My goal is to try to do the unthinkable and veer away from the conventional wisdom of Python. Ruby often isn't considered a great language for scientific computing or for demanding endeavors such as machine learning. I see potential in Ruby and I want to do my best to move things forward.
